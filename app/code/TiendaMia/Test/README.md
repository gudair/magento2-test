## Dependencies

- Magento_Sales

## Description

Services created:

- CheckSpecialPrice: using the `checkSpecialPrice` function we can check if the provided SKU has any special offer. If this is true it will return the special price object.

- RegisterSpecialOfferSale: if the placed order is using any special price from the provider, the `registerSale` function is saving this data into `tm_special_offer_sales` table.
This table information is available on Magento Admin under `Sales > Special Offer Sales`.  

- MockSkuData: This service was created to simulate the provider's endpoint response. This is using the mock data within the file `Model/MockData.json`.
The sku listed in that file belong to the Magento Sample Data products.

Other customizations:

- Special Price is being shown in the frontend. This will be shown if there's any price in our mock data and this value is lower than the regular price.

- Daily reports are being generated by custom cron job `tm_specialoffer_report`. The report results are under `Sales > Special Offer Sales Report`.
